;; individual package modules which include their configurations.

;; Meow digit keys in normal mode act as universal argument without needing C-u prefix.
;; e.g. for doing 10j to move down 10 lines instead of C-u 10 j
;; TODO: Has a bug where if you do 10j and then type 5 to go another 5 lines it does 105; i.e. it's not clearing prior universal argument settings after invoking a movement. Could fix but probably better to use scroll commands or avy or goto-line instead rather than this now that I think about it.

;; Working on a project (think of a simple vc-dir) may involve simple work on one or two files, it may also involve looking at multiple vc-dirs, normal directories, with a specific window layout, various non-file-backed buffers (e.g. an eshell session), some notes and more.

;; EAT notes (TODO: Put somewhere more appropriate)

;; If you invoke M-x eat while in a tramp buffer eat -> eat--1 -> eat-default-shell will result in tramp connecting to the host first before eat gets a shell (good). However, this eat buffer name will be *eat* (unless you launch specifically via M-x eat-project) and if you kill that eat shell but do not kill the *eat* buffer, any further attempt to launch M-x eat will continue to use the settings at the prior time (in this example: it will attempt to re-open the tramp connection) which may NOT be what you expect. Basically, *eat* buffers cache how they spawn the shell AT THE TIME OF THEIR CREATION at not if recycled, so ensure proper naming or C-x k the buffers to prevent surprises.
;; TODO: eat-project appears to name with the project name, have eat also include an @hostname if executed to prevent that behaviour above.

;; shell-file-name is a full path /opt/local/bin/bash (for me) but eat appears to invoke /usr/bin/env anyway so...?
