;;   |  Control  |  Super  |  Alt  |  Space  | ...

;; I remap (using the host operating systems facilities) these to:
;;   |  Nothing  |  Alt  |  Control  |  Spacee  | ...

;; And then replace Caps Lock with Super for that platform. If on Linux I typically use Hyper instead as Linux doesn't discriminate between Control as a system-key like macOS does with Command. Unfortunately Linux decided to copy that choice from Windows. Think C-c being both copy _and_ SIGINT in a terminal; so dumb.

;; This section checks that modifier keys are adjusted accordingly so there are no surprises within Emacs.

;;;;; Grammar sources

;; TODO: Later have a way to specify a specific commit hash instead of just HEAD of a named branch or a tag, but also a way to compile the grammars if they do not exist WITHOUT constantly recompiling them when starting Emacs as-is currently the case with the commented out (dolist) where it is. If that (dolist) is in :config instead it doesn't even run unless the specified language isn't by-default distributed with a ts grammar in Emacs (e.g. zig) meaning if you specify a newer grammar for (e.g. typescript) it wont be automatically compiled unless you interactively call treesit-install-language-grammar. The problem there is the `(unless (treesit-ready-p (car source))` which wraps said expression. Basically auto-installing treesitter grammars with Emacs right now kinda sucks when done at a granular level.
